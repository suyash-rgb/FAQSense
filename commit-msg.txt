fix: Flow Editor positioning bug

Bug Fixes & Refinements:
- Resolved "Invisible Flow" bug in FlowEditor: Fixed a critical coordinate overflow caused by passing `Date.now()` into vertical layout calculations.
- Decoupled React Flow node IDs from positioning logic, ensuring stable rendering and predictable "Zoom to Fit" behavior.
- Fixed lint warning by adding standard `background-clip` property alongside `-webkit-background-clip`.
- Optimized FAQ section with hover-based slide transitions and improved card spacing.

Landing Page Transformation:
- Replaced the static robot image with a high-end, dynamic CSS-based abstract mesh.
- Implemented a full-page, multi-layered gradient background with radial "light leaks" and fixed positioning for a premium feel.
- Upgraded typography and spacing: headings now feature 900-weight builds with linear-gradient text effects.
- Enhanced animations: added 3D perspective rotation to the hero mesh nodes and pulse-glow effects.
