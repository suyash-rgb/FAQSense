feat: enhance chatbot UI and improve enquiry management system

Dashboard & Layout Improvements:
- Redesigned "All Conversations" sidebar with slate-grey background, card-style items, and purple active indicators for better visual separation.
- Fixed layout gaps in Dashboard by optimizing padding and min-heights in ChatbotPreview.
- Added "Open Conversation" button to Enquiry Details modal to support direct context-switching.

Chatbot UI/UX Enhancements:
- Replaced text "Send" button with a custom image (`sendbutton.png`) and modern hover/active scales.
- Improved chatbot fallback behavior: Input field remains visible during query registration to allow immediate rephrasing.
- Added "Dismiss" button to the internal enquiry form for a smoother user experience.

Bug Fixes & Refinements:
- Fixed missing CSS import for EnquiryInbox, restoring modern styling to the enquiries tab.
- Corrected visitor contact data mapping: Automated detection of email vs. phone, ensuring data is stored in the correct backend fields.
- Updated Enquiry Table and Modal to correctly display visitor email/phone details.
- Integrated `react-hot-toast` for better error and success messaging during bot creation.
