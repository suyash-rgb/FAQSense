feat: major dashboard refactor and interactive flow designer integration

This commit introduces a significant overhaul of the dashboard and chatbot management system:

- **Dashboard Layout Transformation**:
    - Refactored the dashboard from a sidebar-based chatbot list to a card-based grid layout in the main window.
    - Updated sidebar to serve as a global navigation hub.
    - Added a `ChatbotCard` component with a premium feel for chatbot selection.

- **Enhanced Chatbot Management Suite**:
    - Introduced a multi-tab management interface for selected chatbots.
    - New sections added: Preview, All Conversations, and Settings placeholders.
    - Refined Knowledge Base, Enquiries, and Analytics views.
    - Implemented a "Back" button for seamless navigation between chatbot collection and individual bot management.

- **Interactive Flow Designer (React Flow Integration)**:
    - Integrated a node-based "Flow Designer" for visual knowledge base management.
    - Developed custom Question and Answer nodes with inline text editing.
    - Enabled automatic Question-Answer pair creation with animated connection lines.
    - Integrated CSV data synchronization between the Flow Designer and backend upload logic.
    - Implemented automatic layout centering and interactive zoom/pan controls.

- **UI/UX & Aesthetic Improvements**:
    - Complete CSS overhaul of the dashboard for a more premium, modern look.
    - Replaced generic tab buttons with high-contrast, segmented toggle controls.
    - Optimized layout responsiveness and typography across management sections.
    - Added decorative tool icons and improved color harmony.

- **Technical Fixes**:
    - Resolved duplicated import errors in `Dashboard.jsx`.
    - Improved component modularity by extracting `ChatbotCard`, `CustomNodes`, and `FlowEditor`.
    - Integrated `ReactFlowProvider` to ensure stable rendering of flow components.
