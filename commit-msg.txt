feat: add Go Live button and embed script generator

This update introduces the "Go Live!" functionality to the Chatbot Preview tab, enabling users to easily embed their trained chatbots onto external websites.

Key Improvements:
- **Embed Script Generator**: Implemented a dynamic script generator in `ChatbotPreview.jsx` that provides a ready-to-use `<script>` tag with the specific `data-bot-id`.
- **Go Live! UI**: Added a premium-styled gradient button with hover animations to the Preview management header.
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Integrated a robust one-click copy mechanism with visual success feedback ("✓ Copied!").
- **Embed Console**: Designed a sleek, dark-themed code block for the script preview, including clear instructions for HTML integration (placement before the closing body tag).
- **Aesthetic Enhancements**: Added `slideDown` animations and transition effects for the new embed section to maintain a premium user experience.

Files Modified:
- `src/components/Dashboard/ChatbotPreview.jsx`: Added embed logic, state management, and the script display component.
- `src/pages/Dashboard.css`: Added animations and hover states for the "Go Live!" integration components.
