feat: implement backend analytics engine and schemas

Commit Summary:

Analytics Aggregation Engine: Implemented 
get_chatbot_stats
 in the service layer to calculate real-time KPIs including total FAQ hits, conversation volume, and enquiry resolution rates.
Structured Data Schemas: Created new Pydantic models in 
app/schemas/analytics.py
 (
ChatbotStatsResponse
 and 
FAQAnalyticResponse
) to ensure consistent and typed data exchange between the API and the dashboard.
Secure Analytics API: Added a protected GET /chatbots/{id}/stats endpoint with ownership verification and refined the service layer to support rich data visualizations while maintaining backward compatibility for chat suggestions.
