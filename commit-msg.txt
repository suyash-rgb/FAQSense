fix: optimize hybrid engine and variant metrics

- Adjusted thresholds for FastEmbed model (BGE-Small)
- Added plural normalization to keyword extraction logic
- Implemented variant-aware ambiguity guard (answer identity check)
  When two questions have the same answer(question variants), the ambiguity guard is not triggered.
- Added 0.92 score bypass for semantic ambiguity
- Updated MODEL_MIGRATION.md and verified lifecycle tests
