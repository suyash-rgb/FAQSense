1. Security & Verification
Webhook Signature Verification: The webhooks/clerk endpoint exists, but we need to implement signature verification using the svix library to ensure only Clerk can call it.
2. [TEMP] Remove Lazy Onboarding: The `get_current_user_id` in `chatbots.py` currently auto-creates users to facilitate frontend testing. This MUST be removed once the Clerk webhook is fully operational.
