1. Security & Verification
Webhook Signature Verification: The webhooks/clerk endpoint exists, but we need to implement signature verification using the svix library to ensure only Clerk can call it.
Environment Setup: provide real MySQL credentials in a .env file and run python init_db.py to verify the table creation.

2. Chatbot Management (CRUD)
Dynamic FAQ Storage: Currently, the system uses a single 
data/faq.csv
. We should implement endpoints to:
Create a new 
Chatbot
 record in the database.
Upload a CSV specific to that chatbot (stored as data/{chatbot_id}.csv).
Tie chatbots to the 
User
 who created them.

3. Conversation & Analytics Engine
Chat API: Build endpoints to:
Start a 
Conversation
 for a 
Visitor
.
Log every 
Message
 (both visitor question and bot answer) into the database.
Analytics Dashboard: Develop read-only endpoints for:
Users: To see the history of conversations for their specific bots.
Admins: To view platform-wide analytics (total bots, active conversations).

4. Integration Logic
Context-Aware Fetching: Refactor the current lookup service to accept a chatbot_id, look up its csv_file_path from the database, and then use Pandas to find the answer.
